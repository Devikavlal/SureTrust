# 1. Spreadsheet Basics, Variables, and Shortcuts!

# Introduction to Spreadsheet
- Spreadsheets were initially developed for storing, analyzing, and manipulating data, and are now commonly used for handling both text and numerical data sets.
- Each spreadsheet is comprised of a grid of cells, with each cell being identified by a unique address consisting of a column letter and row number.
- Many spreadsheet documents include multiple sheets, allowing for referencing values across different sheets within the same file.
- Spreadsheets offer capabilities for producing graphs and other data visualizations.

| Feature         | Description                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active cell     | Anything you type will be entered in the active cell. Any formatting you apply will affect only the active cell.      |
| Row number      | Rows are numbered consecutively from 1.                                                                                 |
| Column letter   | Columns are labeled consecutively with letters. On reaching 'Z', columns are labeled AA, AB, AC, and so on.            |
| Formula bar     | This shows the content of the active cell and can be used to edit it.                                                  |
| Worksheet tabs  | Each workbook may consist of several worksheets, and the tabs are used to switch between them.                         |
|                 | Right-click or double-click the tab to rename or add color markers.                                                     |
| Zoom controls   | Spreadsheets can be very large, so the Zoom controls allow you to view a larger/smaller area of the worksheet.          |
| Ribbon          | The ribbon includes the tabs and controls for all the essential features of the Excel spreadsheet.                      |


When working with a new spreadsheet or worksheet, adjustments may be necessary, such as:

- Adding, removing, or renaming worksheets
- Changing row heights or column widths
- Inserting or removing rows and columns

### Inserting and Removing Rows and Columns

Inserting and removing rows and columns can be accomplished easily by:

- Right-clicking on the row or column header and selecting the appropriate action from the menu.
- Adjustments to row height and column width can be made by using right-click options or by dragging the edges of the rows or columns.
- It's recommended to select the desired number of rows or columns before inserting or removing them to streamline the process.

# Variables

Variables are like memory boxes that you use to store objects (e.g., workbooks or worksheets) or values (e.g., integers, text, true/false). When you set up a variable, it can easily be changed in VBA by performing some calculation with it. There are many different types of variables, but there are two main categories:

1. Object variables that can store objects like worksheets, workbooks, etc.
2. Non-Object variables that store numerical values, text, or similar values.

## Common Variable Types


| Grouping   | Variable Type | Application                                                                                                    |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Numerical  | Integer       | Accepts only integer values, mainly used for counters; value needs to be between -32768 and 32767. Note: You should always use Long instead of Integer. Integer numbers used to be needed to reduce memory usage. But it is no longer necessary. |
| Numerical  | Long          | Accepts only integer values, used for larger referencing like populations; value needs to be between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648 |
| Numerical  | Double        | Accepts decimal values with significant degree of precision; values need to be between -1.79769313486231e308 and -4.94065645841247e-324 for negative numbers and 1.79769313486231e308 and 4.94065645841247e-324 for positive numbers. |
| Text       | String        | Accepts strings of text, usually identified with double quotation marks; if a value is input without quotation marks, it will be automatically recognized as text. |
| Date/Time  | Date          | Accepts dates, needs to be between # signs, e.g., #31/12/1999#                                                 |
| Boolean    | Boolean       | Accepts True or False values.                                                                                  |
| Any        | Variant       | Accepts any type of variable.                                                                                  |
| Objects    | Workbook      | Accepts worksheet names.                                                                                       |
| Objects    | Worksheet     | Accepts worksheet names.                                                                                       |
| Objects    | Object        | Accepts all objects.                                                                                            |
